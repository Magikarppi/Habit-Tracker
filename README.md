<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Backend is build with Node.js, Express and Typescript, and it uses MongoDb as a data storage</p>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>Client side is made with React and Typescript.</p>

<p>The client side uses Cypress for End-to-End (E2E) tests. To run these tests start backend development server in test mode with <br /> `npm run start:test`<br /> <br />frontend with `npm start`<br /> <br />and open Cypress in /frontend with `npm run cypress:open`<br /></p>

<p>The server side uses Jest and Supertest for integration tests. To run these tests run <br /> `npm test`<br /> in backend root </p>
